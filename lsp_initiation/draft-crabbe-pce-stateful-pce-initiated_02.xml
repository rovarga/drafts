      <xref target="RFC4657"/>.  It includes mechanisms to effect LSP state
      synchronization between PCCs and PCEs, delegation of control of LSPs to
      PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of path computations within
      and across PCEP sessions and focuses on a model where LSPs are configured on the PCC
	  and control over them is delegated to the PCE.

    <section anchor="Overview" title="Architectural Overview">

     <section anchor="Motivation" title="Motivation">
	 <t><xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce'></xref> provides stateful control over LSPs 
	 that are locally configured on the PCC. This model relies on the LER taking an active role
	 in delegating locally configured LSPs to the PCE, and is well suited in environments where 
	 the LSP placement is fairly static. However, in environments where the LSP placement needs to change in response to
	 application demands, it is useful to support dynamic creation and  tear down of LSPs. 
	 The ability for a PCE to trigger the creation of LSPs on demand can make possible agile 
	 software-driven network operation, and can be seamlessly integrated into a controller-based network
	 architecture, where intelligence in the controller can determine when and where to set up paths. 
	 </t>
	 
	 <t>A possible use case is one of a software-driven network, where applications request 
	 network resources and paths from the network infrastructure. For example, an application can 
	 request a path with certain constraints between two LSRs by contacting the PCE. The PCE can 
	 compute a path satisfying the constraints, and instruct 
	 the head end LSR to instantiate and signal it. When the path is no longer required by the application, 
	 the PCE can request its teardown.</t>
	 
	 <t> Another use case is one of dynamically adjusting aggregate bandwidth between two points 
	 in the network using multiple LSPs. This functionality is very similar to auto-bandwidth, but
	 allows for providing the desired capacity through multiple LSPs. This approach overcomes two of
	 the limitations auto-bandwidth can experience: 1) growing the capacity between the endpoints
	 beyond the capacity of individual links in the path and 2) achieving good bin-packing through 
	 use of several small LSPs instead of a single large one. The number of LSPs varies based on 
	 the demand, and LSPs are created and deleted dynamically to satisfy the bandwidth requirements.</t>
	 
	 <t> Another use case is that of demand engineering, where a PCE with visibility into both the network state and the
	demand matrix can anticipate and optimize how traffic is distributed across the infrastructure. Such optimizations may
	require creating new paths across the infrastructure. </t>

	 </section><!-- Motivation -->
	 
	 <section anchor="Operation-overview" title="Operation overview">
	
		<t>A PCC indicates its ability to support PCE provisioned dynamic LSPs during the PCEP 
		Initialization Phase via a new flag in the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV (see details in 
		<xref target="Capability-TLV"/>).
		</t>
	
		<t>The decision when to instantiate or delete a PCE-initiated LSP is out of the scope of this document. 
		To instantiate or delete an LSP, the PCE sends a new message, the Path Computation 
		LSP Initiate Request (PCInitiate)
		message to the PCC. The LSP Initiate Request MUST include the SRP and LSP objects, and the LSP object
		MUST include the Symbolic Path Name TLV. </t> 
		
		<t>For an instantiation operation, the PCE MUST include the ERO and END-POINTS object and may include 
		various attributes as per  <xref target="RFC5440"/>. The PCC creates the LSP using 
		the attributes communicated by the
		PCE, and local values for the unspecified parameters. It assigns a unique PLSP-ID for the 
		LSP and automatically delegates the LSP to the PCE. It also generates 
		an LSP State Report (PCRpt) for the LSP, carrying the newly assigned PLSP-ID and 
		indicating the delegation via the delegation bit. 
		The PCE may update the attributes of the LSP via subsequent PCUpd messages.
		Subsequent LSP State Report and LSP Update Request for the LSP 
		will carry the PCC-assigned PLSP-ID, which uniquely identifies the LSP. 
		See details in <xref target="lsp-instantiation"/>.
		</t>
		
		<t> Once instantiated, the delegation procedures for PCE-initiated LSPs are the same as for PCC 
		initiated LSPs. This applies to the case of a PCE failure as well. In order to allow for 
		network cleanup without manual intervention, the PCC SHOULD support removal of PCE-initiated LSPs
		as one of the behaviors applied on expiration of the State Timeout Interval 
		<xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce'></xref>. The behavior SHOULD be picked based on local 
		policy, and can result either in LSP removal, or into reverting to operator-defined 
		default parameters. See details in <xref target="Delegation-and-cleanup"/>.
		</t>
		
		<t>To indicate a delete operation, the PCE MUST use the R flag in the SRP object. As a 
		result of the deletion request, the PCC MUST remove all state related to the LSP, and send
		a PCRpt with the R flag set for the removed state. See details in <xref target="lsp-instantiation"/>.

		<t>A Path Computation LSP Initiate Message (also referred to as

		<xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce'></xref>.
		LSP instantiation is done by sending an LSP Initiate Message with an LSP object with the

        the SRP-ID-number MUST be echoed back by the PCC in PCErr and PCRpt messages

		<t>The State Timeout timer ensures that a PCE crash does not result in automatic and immediate 
		disruption for the services using PCE-initiated LSPs. PCE-initiated LSPs are not be removed 
		immediately upon PCE failure. Instead, they are cleaned 
		up on the expiration of this timer. This allows for network cleanup without manual intervention. 
		The PCC SHOULD support removal of PCE-initiated LSPs
		as one of the behaviors applied on expiration of the State Timeout Interval 
		<xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce'></xref>. The behavior SHOULD be picked based on local 
		policy, and can result either in LSP removal, or into reverting to operator-defined 
		default parameters.</t>

	 <t> The security considerations described in <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce'></xref> 
	 apply to the extensions described in this document. Additional considerations
	 related to a malicious PCE are introduced. </t>

     <section anchor="Malicious-PCE" title="Malicious PCE">
       <t> The LSP instantiation mechanism described in this document allows a PCE to 
	   generate state on the PCC and throughout the network. As a result, it
       introduces a new attack vector: an attacker may flood the PCC with LSP
	   instantiation requests and consume network and LSR resources, either by spoofing messages or
       by compromising the PCE itself.</t>

       <t>A PCC can protect itself from such an attack by imposing a limit on either the 
	   number of LSPs or the percentage of resources that are allocated to honor PCE-initiated 
	   LSP requests. As soon as that limit is reached, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message 
	   of type 19 (Invalid Operation) and value 3 "PCE-initiated LSP limit reached" 
	   and is free to drop any incoming PCInitiate messages without additional processing.</t>
	   
	   <t> Rapid flaps triggered by the PCE can also be an attack vector. This will be discussed 
	   in a future version of this document.</t>
